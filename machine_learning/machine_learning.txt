machine learning step

classification (predict discrete value)
- multiple classification (hotdog, pizza, ice cream)
- binary classification (hotdog, not hotdog)(positive, negative)
regression (predict continuous value)

training model (loss concept)

classification method
1. k-nearest (make classification based on majority in its nearest environment)
2. naive bayes(make classification based on probability in 2 condition based on bayes rule)
3. logistic regression(make classification based on sigmoid function)
4. support vector machines(make classification based on margin line between 2 condition)
