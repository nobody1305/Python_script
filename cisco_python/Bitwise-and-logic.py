# 1. Python supports the following logical operators:

# and → if both operands are true, the condition is true, e.g., (True and True) is True,
# or → if any of the operands are true, the condition is true, e.g., (True or False) is True,
# not → returns false if the result is true, and returns true if the result is false, e.g., not True is False.
# 2. You can use bitwise operators to manipulate single bits of data. The following sample data:

# x = 15, which is 0000 1111 in binary,
# y = 16, which is 0001 0000 in binary.
# will be used to illustrate the meaning of bitwise operators in Python. Analyze the examples below:

# & does a bitwise and, e.g., x & y = 0, which is 0000 0000 in binary,
# | does a bitwise or, e.g., x | y = 31, which is 0001 1111 in binary,
# ˜  does a bitwise not, e.g., ˜ x = 240*, which is 1111 0000 in binary,
# ^ does a bitwise xor, e.g., x ^ y = 31, which is 0001 1111 in binary,
# >> does a bitwise right shift, e.g., y >> 1 = 8, which is 0000 1000 in binary,
# << does a bitwise left shift, e.g., y << 3 = 128, which is 1000 0000 in binary.
# * -16 (decimal from signed 2's complement) -- read more about the Two's complement operation.

#indexing list
numbers = [10, 5, 7, 2, 1]
print("Original list contents:", numbers)  # Printing original list contents.

numbers[0] = 111
print("\nPrevious list contents:", numbers)  # Printing previous list contents.

numbers[1] = numbers[4]  # Copying value of the fifth element to the second.
print("New list contents:", numbers)  # Printing current list contents.

print("\nList length:", len(numbers))  # Printing the list's length.

print(numbers[0]) # Accessing the list's first element.

del numbers[1]  # Removing the second element from the list.
print("New list's length:", len(numbers))  # Printing new list length.
print("\nNew list content:", numbers)  # Printing current list content.

print(numbers[-2])
